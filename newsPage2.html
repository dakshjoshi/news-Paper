        <div class="col-5">Zack Snyder's version of Justice League released on pay-per-view platform BookMy Show Stream in India on 18 March, while it was available internationally on HBO Max. The film has sold over 70,000 pre-orders on BookMyShow Stream, according to Livemint.

            Pre-orders to rent a screening were opened on the platform on 6 March. The film was originally slated to release in 2017, but Snyder, who had previously helmed Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, had left Justice League during the post-production due to a family tragedy.
            
            The studio had then roped in Joss Whedon, best known for Avengers: Age of Ultron, to oversee the situation.</div>
